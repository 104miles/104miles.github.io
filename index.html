title: Dynamic Voltage Scaling
creator: Hamish Sams
date: October 2019
abstract: This report explains what dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is and why it is a useful addition to a circuit. We also discuss how a DVS system can be constructed and how it works along with a case study example of a processor using DVS. Finally we discuss how and when these devices are feasible along with specific applications where DVS would be strongly considered.

<p class="Section">1 &ensp; Introduction</p>
    <p class="BodyText">The majority of ICs (Integrated Circuits) and digital circuitry nowadays is constructed using CMOS technology. One appealing factor of CMOS logic is the low
    static power consumption due to the intrinsic insulated gate.[1] CMOS power
    dissipation can be split into 2 sections, static and dynamic power. Static power is
    from leakage currents through the device and dynamic power arises from device
    capacitors charging and discharging on clock cycles defined by PStatic = IleakV
    and Pdyn = Î±CV 2f respectively. [2] As devices get faster the frequency increases
    dynamic power, as devices get smaller the leakage current gets larger increasing
    static power. [3]Reducing power consumption is a large modern concern and is
    one of the main features holding back technological advance. Reducing power
    is important as many devices depend on batteries for power. Smaller systems
    are strict with their battery sizes and must rely on other techniques to reduce
    power consumption. Device longevity is also affected by reducing power as a 15
    degree rise in temperature doubles the chance of failure. [4]
    A DVS (Dynamic Voltage Scaling) system acts to vary the voltage supplied
    to the processor depending on load allowing for a system to work at the peak
    processing power whilst reducing power usage at non-peak usage. More advanced DVS systems also implement a variable frequency solution, for now this
    system is out of scope of a typical DVS.</p>
